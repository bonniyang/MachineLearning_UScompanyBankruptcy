The primary objective of this project is to leverage an extensive dataset to predict a company's financial stability or its likelihood of facing bankruptcy. We utilize four different types of machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, KNN, and SVM. Our analysis involves a thorough examination of numerous feature variables that provide comprehensive information about financial statement indices, ranging from Current Assets to Total Operating Expenses.

Data Source:

The dataset is from Kaggle, and the company name in the dataset is related to the American public company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.
